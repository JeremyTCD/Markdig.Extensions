# Document CommonMark Specifications NBSP problem
Several specs are supposed to contain non-breaking spaces. Unforunately, the 
document on [Github](https://github.com/commonmark/CommonMark/blob/master/spec.txt#L10) contains ordinary spaces (U+0020) instead. 
This causes several tests to fail (319, 478 and 334).

# Sections Extension
Sections extension should start a "new context" in blockquotes and other sectioning roots. This is in line with the spec, which states that outlines in sectioning roots should not affect outlines in their parents.

# Responsive Tables Extension
Can't use JSON options because PipeTableParser is an InlineParser. With the current architecture, there is no easy way to pass JSON options to the TableBlocks generated by PipeTableParser.
Perhaps PipeTableParser could be a BlockParser, like GridTableParser.

Also, label text generation should not occur in the renderer (which should only be responsible for rendering). Again, because PipelineTableParser is an InlineParser,
there is no convenient hook for that can be used for label text generation.
