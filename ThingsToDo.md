# Things To Do
1. **Cleanup**
  - **General Cleanup**  
    In progress.
  - **FlexiSectionBlocks Extension**  
    SectionBlocks extension should start a "new context" in blockquotes and other sectioning roots. This is in line with the spec, which states that outlines in sectioning roots should not affect outlines in their parents.

2. **Build Documentation Site**  
    Documentation will be much clearer if both the generated markup and the markup rendered with styles are displayed.
3. Misc  
    - **FlexiTableBlocks Extension**  
        Can't use FlexiOptionBlocks for pipe tables because PipeTableParser is an InlineParser. With the current architecture, there is no easy way to pass 
FlexiOptionBlock options to the TableBlocks generated by PipeTableParser. Perhaps PipeTableParser could be a BlockParser, like GridTableParser.

        Also, label text generation should not occur in the renderer (which should only be responsible for rendering). Again, because PipelineTableParser is an InlineParser,
there is no convenient hook for that can be used for label text generation.
